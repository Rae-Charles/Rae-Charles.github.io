        <h1>ABOUT ME:</h1>
        <h3>   Hello, I'm Rachel! I grew up in a small town in Kansas, joined the Army right out of high school and ended up in Fort Hood, Texas for roughly 5 years. 
        <br>   I'm currently in the process of learning full-stack developing from an online schooling program. I own 2 rambunctious cats, a sweet-tempered dog, 
        <br>   and a ball python. 
        <br>
        <br>   In my free-time I enjoy traveling, spending time with my family, binge-watching movies/series, and completing arts & crafts projects. Also, I enjoy

        <h1>PROFESSIONAL SKILLS:</h1>
        <h3>   My 5 years in the military, having served 2 of those years in a combat environment, provide me with a strong sense of teamwork, and have allowed me to develop
        <br>   a steady-head under pressure. As I'm sure you have heard, combat veterans tend to do rather well under high-stress situations, and I am no exception. I always try
        <br>   my best to complete the task-at-hand in the timeframe given.
        <br>   
        <br>   I've always had a strong interest in different types of coding/programming applications, so, the course I am enrolled in now is exactly where I want to be.  
        <br>   I pride myself in the ability to communiicate very well in team environments, having the motivation to learn, and the strength to ask for help when necessary. 
        <br>   I am aware that every programmer/coder using syntax in a different manner, however, I find the idea of learning faster, 
        <br>    more efficient methods of programming a useful tool. </p>
